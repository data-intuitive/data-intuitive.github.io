I share [your passion](http://flowingdata.com/2009/06/04/rise-of-the-data-scientist/) for [data](http://flowingdata.com/), [visualization](http://eagereyes.org/), [design](http://infosthetics.com/), [information](http://www.visualisingdata.com/), [etc](http://www.google.com/search?as_q=data+visualization). Hell, I do. The same way I share the Business Intelligence interests with all the folks in business, small and large. Moreover, I turn out to be [perfectly suited](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html).

I do not agree, however, with the apparent rationalization of all things, tangible and not.

This site is dedicated to finding the balance between data and intuition, between rational and emotional, between left and right brain thinking.

Come back soon for more...

Kind regards,

Toni
