# Short version

No, I'm not at the [spark summit](https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016) in Brussels. Time is not on my side, too much things to do.

But, being there is not necessary when other people make sure they do the publicity for you. 

Thank you [Miel Hostens](https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/speakers/miel-hostens/)!


# Longer version

About two years ago, I gave [a presentation](http://www.meetup.com/Spark-Belgium/events/222632697/) at the first Spark Meetup in Belgium. It's when I met Miel. I think it is fair to say that the architecture and application I was describing back then (and which is still under active development) made Miel realize that what he wanted to achieve was possible.

The talk used to be available as a video, but the link is no longer active. The slides, however, [can be fetched here](http://www.slideshare.net/ToniVerbeiren/getting-data-analysis-to-the-user).

Miel and I have stayed in contact. I'm happy he can get his message across. And I'm happy of course I have played a role in this.
