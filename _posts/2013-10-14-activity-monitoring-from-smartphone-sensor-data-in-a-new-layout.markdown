[![ActivityMonitoring-Cover](http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Cover-231x300.png)](http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Screen.pdf)As one of the assignments of the [Data Analysis Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) class, participants were asked to detect movement type from the sensor data of a smartphone. When I did the assignment, I created the report in Markdown, and converted it using Pandoc. This process was much like I described in [an earlier post](http://www.data-intuitive.com/2013/06/writing-workflow-markdown-pandoc-latex-and-the-likes/).

Recently, [Anneleen Maelfeyt](http://www.anneleenmaelfeyt.be/) has created a document style and logo for texts by Data Intuitive which I converted to a LaTeX template. As a proof of concept, I compiled the Markdown file with the new template. If you're reading on a screen (including tablets), use this version:Â [ActivityMonitoring-Screen](http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Screen.pdf). For printing, there's a version with a modified cover and A4 paper size: [ActivityMonitoring-Print](http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Print.pdf).

An excerpt from the introduction in Markdown format:

    
    Smartphones are ubiquitous, partly because they enhance our 
    lives in many ways. Most recent smartphones have a so-called 
    accelerometer[^1]. This device measure acceleration in 
    3 directions and in some cases also rotation by means of a 
    gyroscope[^1a].
    
    A relatively recent phenomenon is that smartphones 
    (or the applications that run on them) attempt to be 
    aware of the user *context* in the broad sense: location, 
    movement, mood, schedule for the day, etc[^2].
    
    One aspect of detecting the context of the user is movement 
    and activity. Detecting whether someone is walking or sitting 
    down makes a big difference for all sort of things: interests, 
    way of interacting with the device (only thumb or more fingers?),
    etc.[^3]

By the way, the [Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) course runs again starting the end of October. I highly recommend it.
