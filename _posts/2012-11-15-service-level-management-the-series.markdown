Service Level Management (SLM) is the practice of managing the service level and making sure its compliant with the level agreed with customers[1]. As indicated by the word _level_, one often seeks to make sure that service quality and performance are _measurable_.<!-- more -->

In a series of blog articles, we will first give examples of the way in which service levels are traditionally measured, followed by an explanation of how service levels are measured and calculated in most cases. This enables us to explain what is wrong with the current way of working. To conclude, we will formulate ways to improve service level management.

As we will see, many of the arguments are not restricted to SLM alone, but can be applied to bonuses and targets in organizations, for instance.
