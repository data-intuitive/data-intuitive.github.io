<p><em>Say you are the editor in chief of a magazine and you have to decide among two possible cover photos. The magazine draws a significant part of its sales from customers that are not subscribers. In other words, you know the cover is important. Which one do you choose?</em></p>

<p>One editor in chief of a magazine I met recently takes the following approach in this situation: they send both photos to a large number of readers asking them which one they like most. The majority vote wins.</p>

<p>This is a typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> approach and probably the best option available. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Surowiecki">James Surowiecki </a>discusses crowdsourcing in detail in his book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706">The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few</a>’.</p>

<p>Additionally, I argue that the crowdsourcing approach yields a better customer experience because readers are involved in the selection process.</p>
