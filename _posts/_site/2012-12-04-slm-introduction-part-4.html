<p>We introduced the service level in <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2012/11/slm-introduction-part-3/">a previous post</a>. A Service Level can be defined/calculated for one service or a set of services.</p>

<h3 id="service-level-agreement">Service Level Agreement</h3>

<p>A contract with a service provider typically includes several services. An agreement about each of these services and their respective targets and quality parameters is called a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Often, though, the term SLA is used <em>not</em> to denote the contract as such, but rather the Service Level calculated for all the services is in the contract.</p>
