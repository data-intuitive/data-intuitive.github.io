<h3 id="averages-and-sums">Averages and Sums</h3>

<p>One often deals with lots of data points, for instance when considering incidents or service calls to a helpdesk.</p>

<p>Usually, a (small) number of important metrics are selected and calculated on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly). The metrics are defined as <em>averages</em> or sums, such that one number is characteristic for the set of incidents, calls, problems, â€¦ that it covers.</p>

<p>An important metric is often called a <strong>Key Performance Indicator</strong>.</p>
