<p>In business contexts, generally speaking, we believe we act as rational beings. The rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> and the wonders of Number Crunching and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a> make us believe we have entered the era of rational decision making.</p>

<p>It appears to me that this way of thinking is similar to what has been observed in the economic sciences. For long, men was thought of as a rational being, making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">rational choices</a>. It has taken <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/">Kahneman</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Tversky</a> and others several decades to <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2002/10/10/5684/">counter this supposition</a>.</p>

<p>Could it be that the belief in a <em>solely</em> rational business logic is equally <em>false</em>? We have reasons to believe so. The good thing is, one can be a fan of Big Data but nevertheless keep in mind that:</p>

<blockquote>Rationality is just like perfectionism: It can be nice to aim for, but attaining it may take too much effort.</blockquote>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: Please note that <em>non-rational</em> does not imply <em>irrational</em>.</p>
