Long time ago... I used to blog every now and then. It used to be about technology.  
  
I changed focus in my professional career and in the meanwhile started a few other projects that limit my time to spend blogging. It is not that I do not have any ideas anymore, quite the contrary, but they usually involve extensive thinking/writing.  
  
One project recently started is the writing of a book. When people ask me where I got the idea of writing a book, I usually answer that it has always been there, I only needed a topic to write about. Chatting with my good friend Koen Vermeir (see [for instance here](http://www.radcliffe.edu/fellowships/fellows_2009kvermeir.aspx)) we came to the conclusion that we were talking a lot about the same things, from different perspectives. We decided it was time to note that down.  
  
Don't expect a printed copy any time soon, we gave ourselves 5 years! Stay tuned for more info though...
