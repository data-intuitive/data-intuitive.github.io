This morning, I stumbled upon the following tweet:

https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch/status/292140306806231040

It points to a [blog post](http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2013/01/does-reality-improve-when-your-numbers-do.html) by [Peter Skomoroch ](https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch)in which he gives a nice example of the [SLM issue we encountered in our last post](http://www.data-intuitive.com/2012/12/slm-issues-with-traditional-slm-part-3/). I especially liked the part where he quotes a former lecturer of his:


<blockquote>"You'll start off wanting to measure what you value, but you'll end up valuing what you can measure"</blockquote>


Sounds familiar?
