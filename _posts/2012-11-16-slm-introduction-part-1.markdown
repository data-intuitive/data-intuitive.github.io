We start this introduction with some examples of traditional metrics for measuring performance.


### Examples


In what follows, we give some examples of metrics that are traditionally used in SLM in a number of contexts. First, some **callcenter** metrics:



	
  1. Average time elapsed for calls on hold

	
  2. Average number of interactions with customer before problem solved

	
  3. Number of escalations in a given period


The second set of examples are related to **IT helpdesk** services:



	
  1. Average time taken to acknowledge a problem ticket

	
  2. Average resolution time for an incident (with priority 1)

	
  3. Percentage of incidents with resolution time above threshold


The third set of examples has to do with **IT operations**:



	
  1. Percentage systems uptime

	
  2. Unexpected systems downtime

	
  3. Mean time between system failures


We will refer to these examples in later posts. We now turn to some characteristics of the way most service levels are implemented.
