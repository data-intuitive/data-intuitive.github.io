[I wrote about vscsiStats before](http://verbeiren.blogspot.com/2008/03/vmware-vscsistats-measuring-at-virtual.html), but it seems I was amongst the first to do so. Luckily, one of the creators has put some more info [on his blog](http://virtualscoop.org/). [In this post](http://virtualscoop.org/?q=node/16), he refers to [his paper](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/iiswc_2007_distribute.pdf) about the technology.
