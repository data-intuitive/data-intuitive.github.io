I've long been tempted to recreate my website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I had already been experimenting with it for a course website. But now I finally made the switch for my homepage.

For the migration of the content from Wordpress to Jekyll itself, I used [a tool called `exitwp`](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp). It works really well, especially if you follow up the recommendation to use `xmllint` to check the XML generated by Wordpress.

For the styling, I used a theme called [Notepad](http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/Notepad/) and tweaked it a bit.

Oh, and did I tell you Github Pages rock? Testing the site generation locally is easy using `Jekyll serve` and basically by just putting it on Github you get a website. No hosting costs involved!

There's still some work to be done, but the content is there. For the time being, the old website can be reached via its [IP address](http://92.48.206.114).

TODO:

- I still have to migrate the comments
- Work a bit more on styling, especially for code
- Rework the categories
- Add some featured articles, which the Notepad theme has support for.
