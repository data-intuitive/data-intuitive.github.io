In the previous post about SLM, we gave some examples of metrics that are often used in the practice of SLM. We now turn to some characteristics of most service level implementations.


### Averages and Sums


One often deals with lots of data points, for instance when considering incidents or service calls to a helpdesk.

Usually, a (small) number of important metrics are selected and calculated on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly). The metrics are defined as _averages_ or sums, such that one number is characteristic for the set of incidents, calls, problems, ... that it covers.

An important metric is often called a **Key Performance Indicator**.
