A comment by reader 'rbis' on [my previous article](http://verbeiren.blogspot.com/2008/09/definition-of-productivity.html) about the definition of productivity refers to the website and blog of productivity guru [Matthew Cornell](http://matthewcornell.org). The reference reminded me of an article by Matt in which he asks the question: [How do you measure personal productivity?](http://matthewcornell.org/2008/04/how-do-you-measure-personal-productivity.html).  
  


#### The 3 Layers Again

  
In my previous article, I discussed the existence of 3 layers in what people consider (personal) productivity: _Layer_ 1 (L1) deals with so-called life hacks, _tricks_ on how to deal with tasks and things in a smarter way. _Layer 2_ (L2) is about the approach to these tasks and the organization of them, or in other words the _process_. In _Layer 3_ (L3), we look at the _purpose_ behind everything, the driving force behind the whole thing.  
  
When thinking about these layers and the measurement of productivity, two conclusions pop up  
  


#### Measurement Depends on the Layer

  
It is easier to measure in L1 than it is in L3. To give an example: testing ones speed of typing, or the number of blogs topics read is just a matter of counting. The fact that ones purpose is not clear or not lived out, is a much harder nut to crack.  
  
This may sound obvious, but in practice, productivity is often seen as one big beast which has to be tackled with one method.   
  
To come back to [the article](http://matthewcornell.org/2008/04/how-do-you-measure-personal-productivity.html) by Matt, careful reading reveals that if the layered approach had been used, things would have turned out even more transparent. Where he discusses that measures are required, he mostly deals with layer 1 and 2 activities (email processed, poor planning, inneficient meetings), whereas when talking about why measurements are hard, layer 3 comes into play (personal goals, quality instead of quantity).  
  


#### Layer 2 and Layer 3 are not about Counting

  
It will be clear by now that L3 can not be measured by numbers, but qualitative aspects are important. And qualitative by definition means subjective. This is a good thing, but it also makes it hard and confusing.  
  
[Stephen Covey](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221509115&sr=8-1) may try hard to make sure we get our personal mission statement clear, but how many of us really have one? Or how many times a year is this mission statement revised and if needed adapted? Ok, I blame guilty myself.   
  
I think we _feel_ it when our mission or life's purpose is clear and our activities support it. I have noticed lately that two famous bloggers, in two different areas come to a similar conclusion: They were no longer certain that what they were blogging about really made sense to them, that it is what they wanted to do. An insightful article by [Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.com) in this sense [can be found here](http://scobleizer.com/2008/07/22/why-tech-blogging-has-failed-you/), whereas [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/) discusses some of the thought process [in this article](http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/10/time-attention-creative-work).  
  
  
Enough about layers, let's get productive!
