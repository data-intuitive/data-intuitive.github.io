We introduced the service level in [a previous post](http://www.data-intuitive.com/2012/11/slm-introduction-part-3/). A Service Level can be defined/calculated for one service or a set of services.


### Service Level Agreement


A contract with a service provider typically includes several services. An agreement about each of these services and their respective targets and quality parameters is called a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Often, though, the term SLA is used _not_ to denote the contract as such, but rather the Service Level calculated for all the services is in the contract.
