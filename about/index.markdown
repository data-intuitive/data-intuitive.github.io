### Ever encountered _questions_ and _doubts_ like ... ?




> We have invested millions in better **reporting** and **analytics**, but it seems we don't know our **customers** better than we used to.

> We have set **SMART goals** for all of our staff, but they their **productivity** has not significantly improved.

> We are doing the **Big Data** thing, but the hoped insights remain unknown.

> We bought a lot of infrastructure/hardware recently in order to make our infrastructure **redundant**, only to find out we have more severe **outages** now than before.

> We have invested in software that **predicts customer behaviour** based on past records. We have the impression that the intrinsic model is wrong, but we have no way to show it and the supplier has figures to prove it works.

> The development of our new website turned out to **cost double** of the initially estimated amount, but still the former one was better.

> The **support contract** with our supplier was supposed to be airtight, but still he is able to do a **crappy service** at a high cost.

> We are running a strategic project that is currently **running over budget**, we don't want to stop it because we spent a lot of effort already.
