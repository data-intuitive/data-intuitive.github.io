At [Data Intuitive](http://www.data-intuitive.com), we _consult_ and _work_ in all things related to (Big) Data Science and its applications. We have worked in different industries (banking, government, R&D, ...).

Predicting the future is hard, but experience, some cognitive science and a bit of math can help a great deal. Whether it be to advise on choices to make, investments to do, targets to set, and so on.Â [Data Intuitive](http://www.data-intuitive.com) can ask the right questions.

        <p><b>Data Science</b> offers a nice blend of <em>statistics</em>, <em>mathematics</em> and <em>technology</em>. No wonder so many physicists are attracted to it...
        Especially with large amounts of data (<em>Big Data</em>), doing something useful with it tends to be hard. It requires knowledge and experience in different fields and disciplines:

        <p>When we consider the world around us as a Monte Carlo simulation, lots of interesting questions arise. When you combine this with cognitive sciences, things become even more interesting.
        The implications that follow have a big impact on all aspects of life, being it as an individual or on a larger scale (organization, governments, etc.)</p>

Some practical _questions_ and _doubts_ an organization may deal with:

> We are doing the **Big Data** thing, but the insights we hoped for remain unknown.

> We have invested millions in better **reporting** and **analytics**, but it seems we don't know our **customers** better than we used to.

> We have set **SMART goals** for all of our staff, but they their **productivity** has not significantly improved.

> We bought a lot of infrastructure/hardware recently in order to make our infrastructure **redundant**, only to find out we have more severe **outages** now than ever before.

> We have invested in software that **predicts customer behaviour** based on past records. We have the impression that the intrinsic model is wrong, but we have no way to show it and the supplier has figures to prove it works.

> The development of our new website turned out to **cost double** of the initially estimated amount, but still the former one was better.

> The **support contract** with our supplier was supposed to be airtight, but still he is able to do a **crappy service** at a high cost.

> We are running a strategic project that is currently **running over budget**, we don't want to stop it because we spent a lot of effort already.
