<p>In the <a href="http://verbeiren.blogspot.com/2010/02/life-expectancy-difference-between-male.html">previous post</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">life expectancy</a>, we looked at some data of the last 20 years and extrapolated linearly. It seemed as if men and women would finally live equally long somewhere in the next decennium.</p>

<p>While thinking and reading about the way life expectancy is calculated, it struck me that the calculation is not fair. I started out describing the way the calculation is done and why I think it is wrong. During this, I found out that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> page about this topic already contained the answer:</p>

<blockquote>_It is important to note that this statistic is usually based on past mortality experience, and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus such life expectancy figures are not generally appropriate for calculating how long any given individual of a particular age is expected to live. But they are a useful statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. _
&gt; 
&gt; _(from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy))_
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Basically, in the calculation, one assumes that <em>when</em> you are born does not influence the probability with which you will die (at a certain age). This is obviously false.</p>

<p>The article further describes that models exist to adjust the probabilities used in the calculations in order to correct for this systematic underestimation.</p>

<p>Can someone guarantee me that my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance">insurance</a> company uses a corrected statistic instead of the original one? I’m afraid they think I’ll die 10 years earlier than statistically expected and thus charge me too much money?!</p>
