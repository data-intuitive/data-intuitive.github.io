When I did the assignment, I created the report in Markdown, and converted it using Pandoc. This process was much like I described in <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2013/06/writing-workflow-markdown-pandoc-latex-and-the-likes/">an earlier post</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.anneleenmaelfeyt.be/">Anneleen Maelfeyt</a> has created a document style and logo for texts by Data Intuitive which I converted to a LaTeX template. As a proof of concept, I compiled the Markdown file with the new template. If you’re reading on a screen (including tablets), use this version: <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Screen.pdf">ActivityMonitoring-Screen</a>. For printing, there’s a version with a modified cover and A4 paper size: <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ActivityMonitoring-Print.pdf">ActivityMonitoring-Print</a>.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the introduction in Markdown format:</p>

<pre><code>Smartphones are ubiquitous, partly because they enhance our 
lives in many ways. Most recent smartphones have a so-called 
accelerometer[^1]. This device measure acceleration in 
3 directions and in some cases also rotation by means of a 
gyroscope[^1a].

A relatively recent phenomenon is that smartphones 
(or the applications that run on them) attempt to be 
aware of the user *context* in the broad sense: location, 
movement, mood, schedule for the day, etc[^2].

One aspect of detecting the context of the user is movement 
and activity. Detecting whether someone is walking or sitting 
down makes a big difference for all sort of things: interests, 
way of interacting with the device (only thumb or more fingers?),
etc.[^3]

<p>By the way, the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis">Data Analysis</a> course runs again starting the end of October. I highly recommend it.</p>
