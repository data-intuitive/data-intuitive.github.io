<p>We start this introduction with some examples of traditional metrics for measuring performance.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>In what follows, we give some examples of metrics that are traditionally used in SLM in a number of contexts. First, some <strong>callcenter</strong> metrics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Average time elapsed for calls on hold</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average number of interactions with customer before problem solved</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Number of escalations in a given period</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The second set of examples are related to <strong>IT helpdesk</strong> services:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Average time taken to acknowledge a problem ticket</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average resolution time for an incident (with priority 1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Percentage of incidents with resolution time above threshold</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The third set of examples has to do with <strong>IT operations</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Percentage systems uptime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unexpected systems downtime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mean time between system failures</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will refer to these examples in later posts. We now turn to some characteristics of the way most service levels are implemented.</p>
