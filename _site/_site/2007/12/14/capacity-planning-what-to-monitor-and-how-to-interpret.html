<p>Capacity planning starts with capacity (of performance) monitoring.  </p>

<p>Everybody who is involved in the monitoring of systems will acknowledge that the most difficult aspects in monitoring a server (or set of servers) are:  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Finding the proper indicators for the performance of the system (CPU usage, CPU cycles, memory usage, paging, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making sure they are queried regularly, but not too much in order to avoid impacting the performance of the system by monitoring it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storing the resulting data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summarize, create views, average, etc. (this also depends on what you want to know about the system)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze, interpret, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Did I say the most difficult aspects? Are there any other aspects? Well, not really… capacity monitoring (and planning as a further step) is not an easy task:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are you aware of the utilization of your systems?  Even of your workstations?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would you have any idea how many of your servers could be placed on a virtualization platform with a specific set of hardware characteristics?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would you know when your mail server had the hardest time managing mail boxes the last couple of weeks?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Probably the answer is ‘no’. Maybe the answer is ‘I don’t care’?   </p>

<p>Most companies do care, because of several reasons: cost, manageability, flexibility, scalability, environment, space, etc.  </p>

<p>There are already some players on the market: VMware Capacity Planner (see earlier posts), PlateSpin PowerRecon, Veeam Monitor, etc.  I’m mostly used to VMware Capacity Planner (VMCP) but recently, I have also evaluated both PowerRecon and Veeam Monitor. More about this later.</p>
