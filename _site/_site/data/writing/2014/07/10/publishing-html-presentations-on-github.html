<p>You’ve seen those <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Example-Presentations">fancy html presentations</a> on the web? <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js">Reveal.js</a> is a framework to create such things of beauty. And it goes along well with my <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2013/06/writing-workflow-markdown-pandoc-latex-and-the-likes/">Markdown</a> based style of writing, even for presentation slides.</p>

<p>I usually create the presentations on my laptop, using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> to convert to html. In principle, this should be ready for the web by default. If only I had an easy hosting solution to move it to.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> allows you to host html files and even complete web sites. I had never tried it myself, but now I did. It’s really simple. Move your repository into the branch <code>gh-pages</code> (you can do this on the Github website) and finished. The web site is accessible via <code>http://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt;</code>. This is what Github calls a <em>Project Page</em>.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Github uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for building static website from source files in, e.g., Markdown format. When you publish something to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, it automatically kicks in… and gave very vague errors in my case.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, I found out, the best approach is to install <code>jekyll</code> yourself and launch it locally. This immediately gives a readable error message. It turned out I had a stale symlink in my directory tree. Removing this removed the building issue for Github.</p>

<p>The result can be seen here: <a href="http://tverbeiren.github.io/BigDataBe-Spark">http://tverbeiren.github.io/BigDataBe-Spark</a>.</p>

<p>BTW, in order to install <code>jekyll</code> on my MacBook Air, I had to install a newer version of <code>Ruby</code> (tip: use <code>rvm</code> for this, <a href="https://rvm.io/">link</a>).</p>
