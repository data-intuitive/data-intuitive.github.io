<p>This morning, I stumbled upon the following tweet:</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch/status/292140306806231040</p>

<p>It points to a <a href="http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2013/01/does-reality-improve-when-your-numbers-do.html">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch">Peter Skomoroch </a>in which he gives a nice example of the <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2012/12/slm-issues-with-traditional-slm-part-3/">SLM issue we encountered in our last post</a>. I especially liked the part where he quotes a former lecturer of his:</p>

<blockquote>"You'll start off wanting to measure what you value, but you'll end up valuing what you can measure"</blockquote>

<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
