<p>I’ve been writing about my <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2013/06/writing-workflow-markdown-pandoc-latex-and-the-likes/">writing</a> <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2013/10/activity-monitoring-from-smartphone-sensor-data-in-a-new-layout/">workflow</a> <a href="http://www.data-intuitive.com/2014/07/publishing-html-presentations-on-github/">before</a>. Since some aspects of it are related to reproducible research and especially reproducible data analysis, I have <a href="https://github.com/tverbeiren/ReproducibleDataAnalysis">collected some material and tips</a> in a presentation I gave last week on my <a href="https://github.com/tverbeiren">Github</a>:</p>

<p>One aspect that I did not yet mention there, is how I approach this on my Mac. This depends a little bit on what type of text I’m writing. Data analysis is usually done within <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>. It has very good functionality for generating PDFs and the like, but I still prefer my own Makefile and knitr/Pandoc combination.</p>

<p>Less technical texts are usually writing using i<a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">AWriter</a>, but sometimes also in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. iAWriter by default has support for Markdown, Sublime Text can be configured with a very good Markdown plugin. I use <a href="http://marked2app.com/">Marked</a> for previewing, proof-reading, etc.</p>
