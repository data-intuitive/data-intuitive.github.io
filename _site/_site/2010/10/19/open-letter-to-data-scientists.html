<p>I share <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/06/04/rise-of-the-data-scientist/">your passion</a> for <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">data</a>, <a href="http://eagereyes.org/">visualization</a>, <a href="http://infosthetics.com/">design</a>, <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/">information</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=data+visualization">etc</a>. Hell, I do. The same way I share the Business Intelligence interests with all the folks in business, small and large. Moreover, I turn out to be <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html">perfectly suited</a>.</p>

<p>I do not agree, however, with the apparent rationalization of all things, tangible and not.</p>

<p>This site is dedicated to finding the balance between data and intuition, between rational and emotional, between left and right brain thinking.</p>

<p>Come back soon for moreâ€¦</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Toni</p>
