<p>There’s a new word in the Dutch language: <em>infografiek</em>. It’s clearly derived from the English <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic"><em>infographic</em></a>. If this is a trend, it’s only the start. <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a> has a <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/09/29/the-many-words-for-visualization/">nice overview</a> of different names that are all related to this new type of journalism and reporting which blends data with visuals.</p>

<p>The power of this approach to reporting is that it can yield better insight and understanding. The dangers are twofold:</p>

<p>Firstly there’s the risk of overshooting, of spending more time and effort in using a visual approach but ending up with something that doesn’t improve understanding nor insight.</p>

<p>Secondly (and more profoundly), there’s the risk of oversimplication or drawing false conclusions. That is part of what <a href="http://eagereyes.org">EagerEyes</a> refers to when citing <a href="http://eagereyes.org/blog/2011/visualization-is-growing-up">Jason Moore’s version of the Hippocratic oath</a> for infographics.</p>

<p>Let’s hope the Dutch speaking community of artists and journalists who deal with ‘infografieken’ do it in a scientifically correct way.</p>
