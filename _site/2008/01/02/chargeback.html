<p>On the <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/">VMworld website</a>, you can find a <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/vmworld/community/content/chargeback/expert">featured presentation concerning chargeback</a>. The presentation is by the CEO of VKernel, a company that I have mentioned on this blog before.  </p>

<p>Chargeback, as pointed out in the presentation, is about ‘measuring’ and accounting for two types of costs: Consumables and non-consumables. The latter has to do with floor space, licenses, support and administration, etc. Consumables refers to utilization of CPU, memory, power, etc. Obviously, performance monitoring is critical in this aspect.
