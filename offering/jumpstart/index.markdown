If you're not living in a cave without internet access, chances are you've heard of some success stories where data is converted into value: Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc. All these companies and many others use machine learning to get to know their customers better. <em>Why wouldn't you?</em>

What you probably don't want is to spend lots of money on a big project right away just to get a feeling of what value your data might bring. Starting small and taking things from there is the right approach.

Unfortunately, many of the techniques and tools are not (yet) plug-and-play and thus require a specific skill set. That's when external help can be valuable.
