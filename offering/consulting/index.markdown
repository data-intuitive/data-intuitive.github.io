Data projects usually touch multiple parts of your organisation, the skill set involved is likewise. Not only that, the people involved in the implementation of data processing and data models seldom have in-depth knowledge of your data. So communication is crucial and tools need to be suited for this. We have experience in multi-disciplinary situations, experience that can be valuable for your projects.

Other times, you just want an independent view on how data processes or projects are going. This is a role we're happy to play as well!
