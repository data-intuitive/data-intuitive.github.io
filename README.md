# Github hosting

Github does all the necessary stuff, no headaches involved!

# Local hosting/testing

In order to run locally, use the following command:

    jekyll serve -w --config _config.yaml,_config_local.yaml

This correctly configures the `url` option. If you don't, clicking the logo (top left) does not bring you back to the homepage.
